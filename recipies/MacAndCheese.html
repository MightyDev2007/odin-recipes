      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch
          square baking dish.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make the macaroni and cheese: Bring a large pot of lightly salted
          water to a boil. Add macaroni and simmer, stirring occasionally, until
          tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; it will finish cooking
          in the oven. Drain and transfer to the prepared baking dish.
        </li>
        <li>
          While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup butter in a medium skillet
          over low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until the mixture becomes
          paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gradually whisk 2 1/2 cups milk into the flour mixture, and bring to a
          simmer. Stir in shredded Cheddar and finely grated Parmesan cheeses;
          season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir over low heat until cheese
          is melted and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes, adding up to 1/2
          cup more milk if needed. Pour cheese sauce over macaroni and stir
          until well combined.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet
          over medium heat. Add bread crumbs; cook and stir until well coated
          and browned. Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese, then
          sprinkle with paprika.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown and macaroni
          and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes.
        </li>
      </ol>
